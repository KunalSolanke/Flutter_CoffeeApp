Here For adding Firebase to THe project First we will add the database setup to our applicaion




we will install fluuter packages to interact with firebase backend properly

WE WILL GET IT AT PUB.DEV
THESE ARE IN PUBSPEC.YAML


firebase_auth : ^0.14.0+5
cloud_firestore : ^0.12.9+4

WE SHOULD APP THE VERSION PROPERLY 

NEXT PACKAGE IS CLOUDFIRESTORE 



WE WILL STRUCTURE OUR APP :


WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE DESIGN 






WRAPPER IS THE ANCHOR FOR THE APP AS IT TELLS WHICH SCREEEN TO GO




screens.home have all the widgets of homescreen

while 
screen.autheticate will have all widgetsof authentiacte.screen



GO STEP BY STEP  :

DECIDE ABOT YOUR FILE STRUCTURE ,CREATE IT AND THEN MOVE FORWARDS 




WE ARE GOIN TO USE FIREBASE AUTH FOR THE AUTH PROCESS IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR US :


WE HAVE TO ENABLE AUTH PROCESS IN FIREBASE CONSOLE :


ENABLE EMAIL/PASS IN AUTH/SIGN-IN METH IN CONSOLE 
THERE WE HAVE A ANONYMOUS LOGIN WHICH IS VERY EASY WITHOUT EMAIL/PASS





WE AR GOIN TO USE A SEPERATE CLASS WHICH WILL HANDLE EVERY AUTH PROCESS BE IT SIG IN OR REGISTER





MAKING CUSTOMUSER FROM THE FIREBASE USER 



USING STREAM :
       WHAT IS STREAM ?
           WRAPPER IS GOIN TO HANDLE THE AUTHENTICATION :
           STREAM IS LIKE A REAL STREAM FROM ONE PLACE TO OTHER
           WE WILL SET UP A STREAM BETWEEN USER AND FIRE_AUTH 
           FIREBASE HAS A STREAMBUILT IN IT EHICH WE CAN HEAR USING A FUN ONAUTHCHANGE




LOADING WIDGET FOR SOMEKIND OF RESPONSE WE WILL USE A SPINNER 

WE WILL USE A FLUTTER SPINKIT






import 'package:flutter/material.dart' ;
import 'package:flutter_spinkit/flutter_spinkit.dart' ;


class Loading extends StatelessWidget{
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // TODO: implement build
    return Container(
      color:Colors.brown[100],
      child: Center(
        child: SpinKitChasingDots(
          color: Colors.brown,
          size: 50.0,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
  
}




FOR SHOWING NOW DATA WE HAVE TO SETUP THE FIRESTORE 


THERE ARE TWO KIND OF DATABASES :
OLDER REAL TIME DATABASES AND FIRESTORE

FOR PROJECTS CREATE IT IN TEST MODE 

KEY VALUE PAIRS ARE PART OF DATABASE :



BOTTOMSHEET :



void _showSettingspanel() {
      showModalBottomSheet(
          context: context,
          builder: (context) {
            return Container(
              padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 20.0, horizontal: 20.0),
              child: Settings(),
            );
          });









SLIDER :

Slider(
            min: 100,
            max: 900,
            divisions: 8,
            onChanged: (val){
              setState(() {
                _currentstrength =val.round() ;
              });
            },
            value: (_currentstrength ?? 100).toDouble(),
            activeColor: Colors.brown[_currentstrength ?? 100],
            inactiveColor: Colors.brown[_currentstrength ?? 100],

          ),






STREAMBUILDER :
DIFFERNT WAY TO USE PROVIDEER

WHY ? WE NEED TO ACCESS THE STREAMIN ONE SINGLE WIDGET
